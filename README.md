# inventory-counter
Tool for determining the final count of inventory from a collection of CSV files.

This tool is designed to take counts of inventory items in separate CSV files and then combine those counts with CSV files describing different actions taken on inventory, sourced from Quickbooks and bMobile. It then outputs a final count accounting for all these changes.
