# Stalmic Distributors Inventory Count Project
# Created by Aaron Daughtry, December 12, 2016
#
# The purpose of this project is to take data in the form of count, invoice,
# truck load, and transfer data in CSV files (generated from Quickbooks and
# bMobile) and manipulate it to give final inventory figures.
#
# Please see the README file for other documentation.

# Python 2 and 3 compatibility.
